# 🚀 2026 SaaS Boilerplate (Next.js 16 + Supabase + Drizzle)

A production-ready, infinitely scalable Full-Stack SaaS boilerplate. Built with the "2026 Speed Run" stack to maximize developer velocity while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and type safety.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Turbopack, Server Components)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Oxide engine, CSS-first config)
* **Auth & Backend:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL, `@supabase/ssr`)
* **ORM:** [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (Edge-compatible, type-safe)
* **UI Components:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (Owned, customizable components)
* **Interactions:** [@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) (Accessible, touch-friendly Drag & Drop)
* **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Zero-config CI/CD)

## ✨ Core Features

* **Server-First Architecture:** Leverages React Server Components and Server Actions to eliminate boilerplate API routes and reduce client-side JavaScript.
* **Modern Auth Flow:** Uses `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions.
* **Edge Routing:** Route protection handled via Next.js 16 `proxy.ts` (the high-performance replacement for the deprecated `middleware.ts`).
* **Connection Pooling:** Configured to safely handle serverless database connections without crashing Postgres.
* **App Icons Grid UX:** iOS-inspired dynamic grid layout on the home page with hover animations and an emerald-themed aesthetic.
* **Modular Master-Detail Architecture:** Abstraction of complex data views into generic, highly reusable templates (`src/components/templates/`). This enterprise-grade layout effortlessly scales to new CRM/ERP modules using a standard `BaseModuleConfig`.
* **URL-Driven State Management:** Deep linking out of the box with `searchParams`-powered layouts (`?id=123&tab=details`).
* **Interactive Dashboard (Todo Module):** A proof-of-concept CRUD task management system built on the generic module architecture:
  - **Drag and Drop Reordering:** Mobile-responsive, touch-screen compatible vertical reordering.
  - **Inline Editing & Drill-Down:** Seamlessly edit tasks inline and navigate infinite parent/child relationships via Master-Detail drill-downs.
  - **Power User Shortcuts:** Keyboard workflow support (`Enter` to save, `Esc` to discard).
  - **Optimistic UI:** Instant UI feedback on marking tasks, reordering, and saving—eliminating layout shifts and rendering latency.
* **Ready-to-Use Components:** Includes a global authentication Navbar, login/signup forms, and protected user routes.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18+)
* A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account

### 2. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/amcap-nxt-base.git my-new-saas
cd my-new-saas
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. You will need 4 variables from your Supabase project dashboard.

**CRITICAL NOTE ON DATABASE URLs:** Serverless functions require connection pooling.

* Use the Transaction Pooler (Port 6543) for your `DATABASE_URL` (used by the Next.js app).
* Use the Session/Direct connection (Port 5432) for your `DIRECT_URL` (used by Drizzle for migrations).

*Ensure special characters in your database password are URL-encoded (e.g., `#` becomes `%23`, `?` becomes `%3F`).*

```env
# Supabase API Keys (Settings -> API)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-publishable-anon-key"

# Database Connections (Settings -> Database)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[url-encoded-password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[url-encoded-password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
```

### 4. Database Setup (Drizzle)
Push the initial schema (which includes the todos table) to your Supabase database:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

*(Note: If you want to use fake emails during local testing, remember to disable "Confirm email" in your Supabase Auth settings).*

```

## 🚀 Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Add your 4 Environment Variables in the Vercel project settings. (Do not include quotation marks `""` around the URLs in Vercel's UI).
4. Click **Deploy**.

### Post-Deployment Checklist
Once deployed, you must update your Supabase Auth settings so it knows your live URL:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> URL Configuration**.
2. Update the **Site URL** to your Vercel domain (e.g., `https://my-saas.vercel.app`).
3. Add the Vercel domain to your **Redirect URLs** (e.g., `https://my-saas.vercel.app/**`).

## 💡 Adding New Components

To add new UI components via shadcn/ui, simply run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

Example: `npx shadcn@latest add card dialog toast`

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

When you update `src/db/schema.ts` with new tables or columns, sync it to your database by running:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

## 📐 Coding Guidelines

When contributing to this repository, please adhere to the following best practices to ensure efficiency, scalability, maintainability, and reusability:

- **Documentation & Context:** Please provide descriptive docstrings for all functions, components, and significant code blocks.
- **Performance First:** Optimize for rendering performance. Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React by using memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) only when computationally necessary, and by keeping state as close to where it’s used as possible.
- **Optimistic UI:** Always implement Optimistic UI patterns for data mutations to ensure a snappy, latency-free user experience, falling back gracefully on server errors.
- **Component Reusability:** Build components that are small, focused, and single-purpose. If logic is repeated, extract it into a reusable hook or utility function.
- **Type Safety:** Ensure strict typing with TypeScript. Avoid `any` types; define clear interfaces for component props, API responses, and database schemas.
- **Scalable Styling:** When customizing UI components or adding new styles, use Tailwind utility classes consistently. Maintain existing design tokens (e.g., custom variables in `globals.css`) rather than hardcoding values.
- **Clean Code Constraints:** Keep functions short and readable. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure each module or function does exactly one thing well.
